# The <i>h</i>MDS Corpus
The <i>h</i>MDS corpus is a <i>heterogeneous</i> multi-document summarization corpus built with a novel corpus construction approach. It consists of 91 topics coming from 3 different domains. You can find the guidelines which were used by the annotators to create the corpus in the [Guidelines.md](Guidelines.md) file.

## Obtaining the Corpus
The public parts of the corpus can be found in the [hMDS file](hMDS_public.zip). Due to copyright restrictions, we are not able to make the full corpus directly available. The subfolder "input", as described in the readme.txt in the hMDS archive files, is missing. To mitigate this issue, we added link lists containing references to the web pages included in the corpus (see [Guidelines.md](Guidelines.md), step 6 for details) which allows an automatic crawling of the corpus.

Please let us know in case you are interested in obtaining the full corpus. Contact details can be found on the [AIPHES webpage](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/aiphes/aiphes/index.en.jsp).
